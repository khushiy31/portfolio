<h1>My Favourite Movies List</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>One of the classic movie of all time, personally a comfort movie as well. <br/>A really beautifully depicted movie surrounding coming of age. it makes you cry, laugh even feel at home at the same time. </p>
<h3>The notebook</h3>
<p>my personal fav whenever i need a cry ot two.<br/>since crying enough is never an option for me, i go ahead and torture myself more than i have to and watch this movies till i feel sick and hate love and this world at the same time.</p>
<h3>Pride And Prejudice</h3>
<p>Now this is actually what i think is for the classics and top tier romantics. <br/>while i might never get something even minutely close to what this movie has, it makes me feel good knowing that even though in imagination, atleast true love and green flags actually exist</p>
